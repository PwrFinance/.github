# Welcome to Static Finance

**Static Finance** is building next-generation decentralized finance infrastructure, starting with innovative synthetic dollar protocols backed by the power markets.

### Power Protocol

The **Power Protocol** (`power`) is Static Finance's synthetic dollar system, backed by delta-neutral positions in power markets. It enables:

- Minting and redeeming **PWRd**, a dollar-pegged token backed by USD, USDC, or USDT  
- Staking PWRd to receive **PWRs**, which accrue yield from professional power trading strategies
